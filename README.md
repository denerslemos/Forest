# Forest

EDAnalyzer to generate the Forest's for Global Observable (GO) Group using miniAOD as input. 

There are basically three trees: 
  - EventInfo: include event informations like: run, lumi and event number
  - skimanalysis: include the event filters
  - hiEvtAnalyzer: include the GO quantities
  
The code is constructed using CMSSW_11_2_0_pre8. Setup:

`export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc900`

`cmsrel CMSSW_11_2_0_pre8`

`cd CMSSW_11_2_0_pre8/src`

`cmsenv`

Download the code:

`git clone https://github.com/denerslemos/GOForest.git`

`cd GOForest/GOAnalyzer/test`

and Run locally:

`cmsRun GOAnalyzer.py`

or with crab:

`python GOCrab.py`

An example of the Forest file generated by this code can be found on:
